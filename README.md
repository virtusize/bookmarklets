## Getting set up 

Node and NPM need to be installed. Install the Grunt commandline tools
globally:

    npm install -g grunt-cli

Then install all required dependencies:
    
    npm install

## Building the project

To build the project you need to run:

    grunt

That command concatenates the files, uglifies them and puts them in a new
directory called build.

## Watch the project and build continuously

    grunt watch
